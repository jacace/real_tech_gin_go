# Project to analyze github requests

## Intro
Initial goal is to get current team metrics to set goals for future improvements.
According to LinearB Labs' [research] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6v5R7zkbgE), 50% of PRs are idle 81.3/ of lifespan (based on a sample of 733.4K PRs, 3.9 M comments and 25.6K Developers)


## Pull Size Request Best Practices
- [ ] Break Work into tasks that can be completed in a single sitting
- [ ] Start and finish PRs same day
- [ ] Find a reviewer within one hour
- [ ] Make changes right after comments are provided
- [ ] Keep those big refactors to separate pull requests
- [ ] Establish working agrements with your team (e.g.: max PR size is 200 LOC)
